Q:
How do I set this up?

A:
o Click on Scripts at the top of the mudlet window to open the scripting window.
o Click the big green Import arrow at the top of the scripting window.
o Navigate to where you downloaded the system to and import the .xml files or .mpackage there.
o After importing the mudlet package into a new profile in mudlet, go to scripts->system->vitals->variables->options.
o Send the alias, ?setup
o This should toggle all the config commands the system needs to function.
o Adjust the values of the first tables there to reflect your character and your skills.
o Make sure you set your mount, container, and the can and toggles variables!
o Make sure you have GMCP enabled.
o All set! System will track everything else through GMCP!


Q:
How do I enable GMCP?

A:
o You will need to download the nifty little mudlet update found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mudlet/files/Mudlet-2.0-test4b.exe/download
o Install the update you have downloaded.
o Open mudlet like normal.
o In mudlet, go to settings, and make sure 'Enable GMCP' is clicked in the general tab.
o Reconnect to the game if you had to click the GMCP box.

--NOTE! GMCP enabled has a compatability issue with Midkemia's html tags. You can CONFIG MXP ON to cause html tags to be sent as mxp tags instead and avoid this issue. If you don't, any output between < and > will always be gagged, and the client won't receive it.


Q:
My prompt isn't showing, or isn't showing properly! Help!

A:
o Make sure you enabled GMCP! See above for how to do this.


Q:
I found a bug! What can I do to help you fix it?

A:
o If possible, try to save a log of the bug occuring.
o If the main mudlet window displays a lua error, make sure to copy that error down somewhere!
o If the main mudlet window doesn't have an error, open the scripting window, and then the debug window.
o Having the debug window will cause gmcp events to display in the main window, this is normal.
o Watch the debug window and try to recreate the bug. Errors are displayed in white text on a red background in the debug window.
o If you do get an error message, you can highlight and then right-click and select copy to save it.
o Once you've got an error message, or can positively say there isn't one, write me up a report!
o Include the error message, as much detail about the circumstances of the error as possible, and any logs or records you have of the error occurring.
o Send me a letter or message in game, or post on the system's forum thread, or send me a forum pm.
o I might get back with you asking you to try or test or change things and looking for more feedback, but I promise to work on it as soon as possible!


Q:
I installed the mudlet update above, but now I can't launch mudlet! It's telling me this: error launching the application couldnt find MSVCR100.dll

A:
o This is an error in some versions of windows, not with mudlet, mudlet update, or the system.
o To fix this, go here: http://dllinfo.dll-free-download.org/engine/rss.php
o Use CTRL+F to search for your error message.
o Click the link there to download the missing .dll file.
o Mudlet should now open fine for you!


Q:
How do I update to a newer version of the system?

A:
o Whenever you import the system, it should save all the settings into three files, one each in triggers, aliases, and scripts.
o The easiest way to update is to import the new mpackage, and then delete the three old files.
o Make sure any aliases, triggers, or anything else you want to keep across updates is saved outside of those three files!
o The system will automatically store everything in the options script (such as your can variables, mount name, weapon type, and toggles) across sessions and updates, so you don't need to set them again.
o If you import the update into a new profile, you WILL need to set all the options again, because it saves them to the profile with the system on it.
o If you delete the wrong folder, or need to re-import the same one for whatever reason, you may need to remove the old package in the package manager.
o To remove an old package, click the Package Manager along the top of the main mudlet window.
o Click the package to remove.
o Click uninstall.
o You can now re-import the same package.


Q:
I imported it like you said, but it seems to have only imported the aliases. What's up?

A:
o Sometimes this happens, not sure what causes it. To fix it, you can import the individual .xml files.
o Before you do this, try exiting mudlet and opening it again, sometimes the other sections just don't show up at first. If they're still missing, continue on.
o Go to where you saved the folder from the link on the forum.
o Right click on the system.mpackage file.
o Click extract. This should create three .xml files in the place of the old .mpackage one.
o You can now import the missing settings, which should be the scripts.xml and the triggers.xml.


Q:
It keeps double sending everything! I can't toggle anything off because it toggles it on immediately! Why does it do that?

A:
o You somehow managed to import the aliases twice!
o Go to aliases and delete one of the two system folders there. This should fix the problem.
o If there's only one system folder, but it's definitely doubling commands, try exiting mudlet and opening again. This should reveal any hidden folders.
o If you exit and re-enter mudlet and there's still only one folder, make sure it really is double sending. It could just be echoing the alias name and the command send, which might be the same.
o If it is just double-echoing and this bothers you, you can go to mudlet's settings and un-click the 'Show text I send' box to make it no longer display these things.


Q: What's with my prompt?

A:
This system replaces the standard prompt with one that I feel is more helpful. The new prompt looks like this:

100%h, 340e, 0g, 83.02x xb-pl A:50% - [zorn] H:+16

o Health, by percentage.
o Endurance, standard numeric.
o Magic, by percentage, or faith/guile in standard numeric.
o Experience percentage toward your next level.
o Essentials (equilibrium, balance, riding, and spellshield/psi balance/off-hand balance/roar balance if they apply). These are replaced with a - if you do not have them.
o Status indicators, immediately following your essentials. This will display characters for sleep, unconsciousness, prone, stun, and entanglement.
o Adrenaline percentage.
o Current target in square brackets. If bashing, this is your bashing target. If not, this is your PvP target.
o The old target health indicators have been replaced with colorized percentage ranges.
o Change in vital stats. This will display health and endurance, as well as magic/faith if it applies.


Q:
How do I see a list of commands?

A:
o There's a halp alias that displays a list of most of the commands available to your current class. Use it!
o Your attack aliases are listed under your class' folder in the skills folder under aliases.


Q:
What's with all the weird colors?

A:
o I personally read REALLY slow.
o I replaced a lot of the text seen in combat with much much shorter text.
o The colors help me to keep up.
o If you do not like them, there are toggles to display or not display the attack and defending echoes.
o There is currently no toggle for affliction of defenses echoes (like You: GAIN arcanepower).


Q:
How do I make it bash?

A:
o Enter your bashing area. The system should automatically load targets for that area. If not, SURVEY to grab them.
o The system should display the possible targets. If not, your area is not loaded into it.
o The alias aa will start running the bashing script.
o The alias ff will toggle fasthunt on or off. With fasthunt on, changing rooms will cause the system to check WHO HERE and start bashing if you are alone.
o The alias gg will gather coins and any items that may be dropped in the area you're in.
o The alias tgg will toggle gathering of coins when they drop.
o The alias ast will stop running the bashing script.
o The alias asp will stop running the bashing script after the next time you kill something.
o You can toggle your ability to use various class skills in the list of can variables under scripts->system->vitals->variables->misc.
o The toggles for using class skills are listed under aliases->system->toggles.


Q:
It's not bashing! Help!

A:
o If the system is not sending IH when you use aa, make sure your prompt is properly replaced.
o If your prompt is right, but it's still not sending IH, check that your prompt reflects that you have balance, and are not stunned, unconscious, or writhing. If one of these is wrong, use the rst alias and try again.
o If the system sends IH, but then doesn't hit, or tries to hit something repeatedly that isn't there, make sure the area you're in is loaded into the area list table!
o If none of this fixes your problem, and rst doesn't either, contact me with your class and any information about the issue and I'll try to fix it for you.


Q:
How do I add new bashing areas?

A:
o Go to scripts->system->utilities->bashing->area list.
o Look at the table there.
o Insert a new line in the table with the information for your area.
o Let me know so I can add that line to future updates!


Q:
Why won't fasthunt mode work?

A:
o Fasthunt mode will only work if you are bashing alone.
o It will always check that you are alone in a room before hitting.
o This is on purpose and I will not change it in future updates, because I do not want people to turn fasthunt on, follow someone else, and walk away from the computer.


Q:
How do I make it fish?

A:
o The alias cbait <type> will load the bait you wish to use. Like, cbait minnow.
o The alias dr <direction> will load the direction you wish to fish in. Like, dr n.
o The alias fdis <medium|long> will set the distance to cast at.
o The alias fsh will toggle fishing on and off.
o If you find a bug or problem, let me know! I don't fish, so I don't encounter most fishing errors, and don't know to fix them.


Q:
It won't let me sleep! What do I do?

A:
o The alias ss will toggle standing on and off.
o You must use this if you wish to sit, sleep, or otherwise remain prone.


Q:
How do I make it keep up defenses?

A:
o The alias kd <defense> will toggle keeping up specific defenses. Like, kd insomnia.
o You can also use the ldd <table> alias to load defense options tables.
o You can create your own defense option tables in scripts->system->healing->defenses->options.


Q:
How do I make it queue my attacks?

A:
o Attack aliases are listed under aliases->system->skills, with a folder for each class.
o Use the attack alias for the skill you wish to use.
o If you have balance and are able to attack (not prone, stunned, entangled, etc), the system should use your attack.
o If you are not able to attack, you should get a message saying you queued that attack.
o You may only queue one attack in advance.
o Attack queuing will only work if killing is toggled on.
o The alias kil will toggle killing on and off.
o The attack aliases will try to hit your targ variable, which is your PvP target.
o You can set targ with the t <target> alias. Like, t zorn.


Q:
I don't like your alias names. They're not intuitive or easy to remember for me.

A:
o So change them! Just change the pattern box to something easier for you to remember.
o If you do change them, make sure to move the folders containing the aliases you changed outside the main system folder.
o When you update later, just delete the new versions of the folders you altered. If you keep the old one, your aliases will remain the same.


Q:
Can I make the attack queuing work with keybinding?

A:
o Just copy the value of the alias you want into your keybinding.
o It will work exactly the same! Will send attack if able, or queue it if not.


Q:
What other toggles and commands do I need to know?

A:
o The alias ?help will give you a pretty comprehensive list of commands and what they do.
o The alias cfs will send credits for sale, and will automatically try to buy any credits under 6000 copper.
o The system will continue learning from players or tutors you begin learning from. Leave the room to cancel a learning session.
o Make sure to let me know of any bugs or problems you find! I can't fix what I don't know about!
